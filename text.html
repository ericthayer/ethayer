<p>Thank you Samantha. I’m currently the designer and front-end dev for a mobile messaging product. I’m doing the best I can to handle multiple roles but it’s difficult without the support of a team or even a project manager.</p>

<p>After I started to play around with IxD software, Adobe XD in particular for comps and prototypes is when my love for design was rekindled. I also I love to code and think that HTML/CSS/JS based prototypes are the best way to test user interaction design. What I have also come to understand over the past few years is I also love shaping the brand message and process in which the design or front-end development teams use. </p>

<p>I don’t want to be just another cog in the production machine. I want to learn how to contribute and grow a product or brand with the collaboration of a senior design team. What I need more than anything is what I have never had. Mentorship.</p>

<p>My dream is to be part of design team that works on making the internal tools and systems work better to maximize the overall performance of the design process and product experience. This would include the development and maintainability of large code and design systems (style guides) and the education and documentation of these systems for our internal use as well as a public resource. </p>

<p>In this dream role, with my team, I would…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Design and maintain style guides, pattern libraries or any other resource to help with the design or development of any brand or product elements needed. (We are sticklers for organization and visual order and believe in one code base to rule them all.)</p></li>
<li><p>Share a passion for people and make sure accessibility needs are a priority. (We care about everyone from the start and how we impact them.)</p></li>
<li><p>Perform constant performance audits and develop ways to make sure our interactive experiences are the fastest and are as natural as can be. (We can’t stand irresponsible design and development and wonder about the cost of using our product.)</p></li>
<li><p>Make design decisions based on working with real people. (We come up with ways to make our users&#8217; lives better. We strive to make it easy and enjoyable to use anything we build.) </p></li>
<li><p>Develop concepts and experiment with ways to make everything we “build” better. (We stress the importance to improve the code and the processes our interactive experiences are built on.)</p></li>
<li><p>Design in the open. (We share our progress and struggles in the public and explain why we do what we do. It&#8217;s important we explain what we learn along the way.)</p></li>
<li><p>Contribute to open source projects or a non-profit project once a year. (We are thankful for the wonderful community in which we a part of and want to give back.)</p></li>
<li><p>Build prototypes, static or code based, and send it out for assembly. (We don’t really want to worry so much about fixing them bugs. Okay this one is a bit selfish but it is my dream :-P)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think the problem why I’m not getting any callbacks for UX designer roles is because I do not have a self-designed portfolio or any experience in that type of position. I know I need to figure out a way to capture what I’m doing now but I just can’t find the time while trying to meet deadlines and make time for my family. This is why I want to focus on building a UX portfolio or at least get some guidance towards ways to improve my chances in moving in this direction.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Eric</p>
